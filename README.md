# Discofy

## About
Discofy is a hackathon project made in 20 hours. We wanted to create a fun, educational experience that explores the unique and iconic era of disco fashion. This periodâ€™s influence on modern style is undeniable, and we aim to bring this history to life in a fresh, interactive way to teach our users about how fashion has evolved over the decases.
